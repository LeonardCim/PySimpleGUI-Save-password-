# PySimpleGUI-Save-password-



## Small description

Executable written in python that allows you to save passwords in an encrypted file. 
Besides this there are other functions that you can use, for example you can save the file with the passwords in another file but visible.
Or you can delete a password that you no longer want to have or because it has been changed.

The executable has an interface created with PySimpleGUI. 
A perfect package for those who want to start creating simple, fast and beautifully designed interfaces.



## A fun project

I think these small and simple projects are not only fun but also very useful. 
On the one hand, there is the fun and passion of writing code and solving problems. 
On the other hand, instead, you begin to become familiar with the process of creating a web application (and not).

Furthermore, simply creating an algorithm in which the pieces work harmoniously with each other is critical to improving and growing in programming. 
And what's the best way to do it if not by creating these little projects?
Therefore, although it may seem conceptually trivial as a project, it is part of a growth path that will lead to making things increasingly complex.

And one day, in a couple of months or years, I will go back to review my old projects, observing the mistakes, the beautiful things and the simplicity of those who were growing up in this wonderful world.


## Libraries

In addition to PySimpleGui, I used the following libraries in the project:

- Win32 API, win32con
- Cryptography
- ConfigParser
- Pandas
- CSV
- Os


## Note

This small executable will be subject to some changes over time. In fact, I intend to improve it further with some updates.

Leaving it as it is would not be fair and professional. Because if something can be improved it must be done.
And here too the concept of developing an application returns. 
Because a thing is never finished once it is released, but on the contrary it can be improved and grown by fixing what is not working.


## Some pictures

This is the first thing you will see the program started:
